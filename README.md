# Face-Landmark Detection and Privacy-Preserving Implementation Using Pytorch
This repo implements a five-landmark detection based on UKTFace (cropped, aligned), including nose, eyes, and mouth, with *Resnet18* and *ViT* as backbones for comparison,
Both are fine-tuned using LoRA adapter, and the effect of adding noise to images via FFT is discussed, followed by different methods to "Attack" the model. 
e.g., Wiener Filtering, trained U-net, and so on. Easy for starters to get familiar with face recognition algorithms and implementations.
